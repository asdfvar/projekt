set the definition of cells in the selection box as cells that are completely contained within the bounds

define total energy "Joules" required to complete the action and define a power in the units

replace "actions" with "jobs"

highlight the path of each unit in the graphics

make subclasses of the container type specific to the units and actions to support custom functionality

enforce restrictions on how many threads can be accessed simultaneously. for units, this means only setting a path if less than *N* other units are setting a path where *N* is the number of simultaneous threads supported by the hardware

define grounded cell as a cell that can draw a connected path (with adjacent cells only) to the bottom

rename method "map_dim" to "size"

write conversion routine between window view and map position

make job subclass specific to the type of job it is

update air and ground cells individually rather than recompute them everytime so that they can be managed independently of actual cell material (i.e. a job in the process of filling in a space)
